# Converting your MyHeritage data to 23andme

Many tools just use 23andme data, that is why I used Python to write a script to convert MyHeritage data to 23andme. 
You will need Python 3 installed together with the library Pandas.

## How to

1. > git clone https://github.com/JustinGuese/convertMyHeritageDNAdataTo23andme
2. Download raw DNA data and put it into this directory https://faq.myheritage.com/en/article/how-do-i-download-my-raw-dna-data-file-from-myheritage
3. Install Python 3 if not done already (e.g. https://anaconda.org/)
4. Install requirements > pip install pandas
5. > python convert.py
